	/* Java Abstraction - 
	 	I. It is a process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality to the User.
	 	II. In java in Abstraction Point of view - two types of methods in Java,
	 		i) Concrete Methods. (Methods with body)
	 			Ex:
	 				public void add()
	 				{
	 					statement I;
	 					statement II;
	 					-----------
	 				}
	 				Suppose in a Class there are n methods and all the n methods are Concrete Methods, then that Class can be defined as a Java Class.
	 		ii) Abstract Methods. (Methods without body)
	 			Ex:
	 				public void sum();
	 				If there is a class with n methods and if one or all the methods are Abstract Methods then we can say that Class is an Abstract Class.
	 	III. If we know the method name but don't know the functionality of that method, then we can use Abstract Methods.
	 	IV. Java Class contains 100% Concrete Methods.
	 	V. Abstract Class contains one or more Abstract Methods.
